<p> I'm currently 17 years old and attending Armstrong Senior High School. I adore reading, writing, learning, and working on projects such as this one. I would say my grades are decent, some could be improved, but most classes require typing and I unfortunately do not have a computer at home, which makes my assignments late.</p>
<p> I have one older sister that lives with me and I used to help her understand certain words for English when she was in school. She struggled with words since they wouldn't register in her head. She graduated last year and I'm really proud of her even if I don't show it all the time. Tutoring her was fun, even if she struggled at times. I'm not the best at getting how I view everything across so that might have been my fault as well.</p> <p>My goals after high school would be to go to college for the basic classes while trying to find what major would best suit me. I'm leaning towards Law and English although I'm starting to like designing web pages. </p>
<p> Languages in general are a big part of my learning currently. I took four years of French and I'm in Mandarin Chinese this year. I retain the words fairly easily, but, the characters are what I struggle with. I had very high A's in French when I took that class and I have very high A's in Chinese as well. </p>
