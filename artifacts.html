<center><h1>1. Children's Book for Creative Writing </h1>
<img src = "images/kidsbook.png" height = "300" width = "500" /></center>
<b><p>I wrote a small children's book for my Writing for Communications class. It was about a civil trial case where a student stole candy out of someone else's cubby.I had a lot of fun developing the characters</p>
<p> This project improved my writing ability, as well as my ability to direct a story towards a different age group. I learned a lot about my writing style. The drawings I did for the book were not my best, but it was just a book for younger kids. </p> </b>

<img src = "images/books.jpg" height = "300" width = "500" /></center>
<b><p>In 2017, I went to the YSU English Festival with my school. It was interesting and I met a lot of people with similar likes to mine. They even had the authors of two books we read for it! </p>
<p> Participating in the English Festival gave me the chance to use my knowledge from reading the given books. There was a multitude of activities that gave the chance, and I even got placed for a trivia game-although that was a group effort. </p>

<center><h1>3. Amur Leopards Web Design Project</h1>
<img src = "images/website.png" height="300" width="500" /> </center>
 <p> This project was the first in Web Design where we had free reign over the entire thing. It was before we knew about css and had to do all of the style changing on that html sheet. I tried my best to make it look good and I'm still proud of the finished work.</p>
 <p> The project taught me that I could do anything as long as I try my hardest. It improved my ability to work around a problem and find a solution even if it's not the first option. I worked on it twice a day, during the class and seminar to make sure it was good enough to turn in. It made me realize that I like working with computers and creating something, such as a web page.</p>
